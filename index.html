                <br>
                <p>A carefree SCUBA diver, Flynn McConnell resurfaces in distress to find a global catastrophe - the earth's atmosphere is unbreathable. All life including her doting fiancee, friends and social media have been silenced. Each breath she takes brings her closer to her own doom but when she finds three other survivors of the cataclysm, a Doctor, a conspiracy theorist and a ten-year old girl, they form a pact to band together and uncover what's behind the only sign of life left on earth: mysterious online activity deep within the mountains of Montana.</p>
