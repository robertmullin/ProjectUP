                <h2>Under Pressure</h2>
                <br>
                <p>When SCUBA diver and whale-watcher Flynn McConnell takes a marine
                    research team offshore, her dive mission suddenly turns hellish with
                    creatures dying and in distress all around her. Returning to the surface
                    she finds a global catastrophe: the atmosphere is unbreathable. All life
                    has perished. Is it terrorists, a climate cataclysm?</p>

                <br>

                <p>With just two air tanks remaining each breath brings Flynn closer to her
                    own doom. Her doting fiancee is not responding to her urgent calls - nor is
                    anyone. The global media and social media are silent. Flynn is in a race
                    against time like no other to survive.</p>

                <br>

                <p>When she finds a mysterious doctor and a conspiracy theorist, they form
                    a pact to survive this apocalypse together, and soon their trio becomes
                    four when they save a 10-year old girl. The survivors, with air tanks in tow,
                    make a perilous journey to the only sign of life on earth: daily online
                    activity in the mountains of Montana - but what they discover there is
                    beyond all belief. Four good souls are pushed to their limits exposing their
                    own secrets. They each face the question of the value of a single life
                    versus all life - and what would you do to protect it?</p>
